# Fix Foreign Key Constraint Error - Migration Plan

## Steps Completed:

1. [x] Modified `2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php` to remove foreign key constraint
2. [x] Created new migration `2025_08_30_003722_add_foreign_key_to_users_table.php` for adding foreign key constraint
3. [x] Successfully ran migrations - fix confirmed working

## Solution Summary:
- Changed `users` table migration to use `unsignedBigInteger('role_id')` instead of foreign key constraint
- Created separate migration to add foreign key constraint after both tables exist
- Migration order issue resolved - foreign key constraint now works correctly
